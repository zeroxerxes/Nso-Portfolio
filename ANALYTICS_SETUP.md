## 📊 Google Analytics Setup for Your Website

### Step 1: Create Google Analytics Account
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Click **"Start measuring"**
3. Set up your account and property

### Step 2: Get Your Tracking ID
1. After setup, go to **Admin** → **Property** → **Data Streams**
2. Select your website stream
3. Copy your **Measurement ID** (looks like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 3: Add to Your Website
I'll add the Google Analytics code to your `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

**Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID!**

### Features You'll Get:
- 📈 **Visitor Analytics**: Page views, unique visitors, bounce rate
- 👥 **Audience Insights**: Demographics, interests, location
- 🔍 **Traffic Sources**: Where visitors come from
- 📱 **Device Data**: Mobile vs desktop usage
